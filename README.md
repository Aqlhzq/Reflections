# Reflections
a. Summarize what you have gained from the assignments and project.
- What I gained from the assignment and projects was how we need each of our team mates in completing an assignment or project.
- Teamworks was the other part that I have learned a lot from.
- Lastly, you got to do your part by yourself because no one can help you with that

b. Suggest any improvement. 
- I suggest for my teammates to know what the assignment assign us to do.
- Completely understood what to do, not in the middle of working.

c. Others: You can add more reflection based on your opinion, idea, and creativity.
- I hope lecturer can always be in the class to teach us.
- Although we are university student, we still need a person to guide us in something that we never learn of.
